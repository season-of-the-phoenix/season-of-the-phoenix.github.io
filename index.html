                <li>
                    The main focus of the past several seasons has been new
                    content. As a result a lot of the old content and mechanics
                    have fallen by the wayside.

                <li>
                    Season of the Phoenix is our attempt at semi-realistically
                    designing a Season based upon updates and fixes whilst
                    focusing on the core gameplay experience for players.

                    These are all suggestions, not necessarily balanced
                    solutions. We want to spark discussion over the topics
                    mentioned below.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The overarching goal of this season is to improve the Core
                    gameplay experience of Destiny2, the activities players
                    engage in, on a daily and weekly basis. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We want players to log in and be excited to check what's
                    happening that week. Whether it be the modifiers on their
                    favourite activities or what vendor rolls are available. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This will be supplemented with a huge wave of Sandbox
                    changes, Quality of Life updates and fixes. These will be
                    specifically targeted towards players’ daily experience and
                    gameplay as well as incentivise some not so desirable
                    activities. 
                </li>

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): A very brief overview for a small seasonal
                quest consisting of several missions.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ultimately we feel this is not the place to detail a 
                                <div class="tooltip">complete story line.

                                    Would require much more in depth work and

                    However, here are some storylines we would love to see
                    Bungie explore more:

                <li>
                    We also believe it would be interesting to see multiple story
                    lines/arcs in a single season and stories/npc's from previous 
                    seasons. E.g. House of Wolves side quest in The Taken King 
                    expansion from Destiny 1.

            <h3>Strikes/Nightfall</h3>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): Give strikes replayability. Give players the
                feeling that they’re working towards something, as opposed to
                waiting for a random drop with no tangible progress.

                <li>
                    Skeleton Keys can drop from strikes/heroic strikes with a

                <li>
                    Nightfalls have a 70->100% chance to drop a skeleton key

                    New weapons have been created for Strikes which had no
