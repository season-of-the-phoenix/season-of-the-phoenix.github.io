            <h3> Disclaimer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The main focus of the past several seasons has been new
                    content. As a result a lot of the old content and mechanics
                    have fallen by the wayside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Season of the Phoenix is our attempt at semi-realistically
                    designing a Season based upon updates and fixes whilst
                    focusing on the core gameplay experience for players.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These are all suggestions, not necessarily balanced
                    solutions. We want to spark discussion over the topics
                    mentioned in this Google Doc.

                    Most (95%) of this Document was written before the release
                    of Season-12 and the air of Bungie's Year-4 reveal live
                    stream on the 9th June.

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The overarching goal of this season is to improve the Core
                    gameplay experience of Destiny2, the activities players
                    engage in, on a daily and weekly basis. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    We want players to log in and be excited to check what's
                    happening that week. Whether it be the modifiers on their
                    favourite activities or what vendor rolls are available. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    This will be supplemented with a huge wave of Sandbox
                    changes, Quality of Life updates and fixes. These will be
                    specifically targeted towards players’ daily experience and
                    gameplay as well as incentivise some not so desirable
                    activities. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Story</h3>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): A very brief overview for a small seasonal
                quest consisting of several missions.
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ultimately we feel this is not the place to detail a
                    complete story line (Would require more in depth work and
                    its own design document).
                </li>
                <li>
                    However, here are some storylines we would love to see
                    Bungie explore more:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A new Speaker (possibly still a child?).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Continuation of the Uldren story.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scorn (Fikrul).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More of The Nine.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ashur Mir (Turning into a vex?).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The new Hunter Vanguard.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Shadows of Yor (Evil ghosts?).
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strikes/Nightfall</h3>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): Give strikes replayability, give players the
                feeling that they’re working towards something, as opposed to
                waiting for a random drop with no tangible progress.
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    At the end of each strike a skeleton chest will spawn,
                    allowing guardians to use a Skeleton key to guarantee a
                    drop from the strike’s loot pool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Skeleton Keys can drop from strikes/heroic strikes with a
                    10/40% chance. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nightfalls have a 70-100% chance to drop a skeleton key
                    depending on the difficulty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Skeleton Keys stack up to 20.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Moved all Nightfall specific loot to their strike versions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All strikes now have unique weapons with random rolls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    New weapons have been created for Strikes which had no
                    weapons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A wide range of visually interesting armour has been added
                    to most strikes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These armour pieces had been modeled to follow the visual
                    theme of the strike.
                </li>
                    Removed the three weekly Nightfalls and its guided games. 
                <li>
                    The weekly strike challenge no longer requires you to match
                    your subclass element with the weekly singe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Nightfall: ordeal Adept and Hero light activity has
                    been removed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Legend, Master and Grandmaster Nightfalls still remain
                    with the intent being:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Legend: Matchmade activity, for most nightfalls, able
                        to obtain the 100k pinnacle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Master: Farming for enhancement prisms and ascendant
                        shards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Grandmaster: A supremely difficult challenge and for
                        the Title.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    The Grandmaster Nightfall has been fixed and tweaked.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Awards 2 Ascendant shards guaranteed upon first
                        completion per account (Regardless of time left,
                        lives left or champions killed).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Subsequent completions award master level rewards
                        (platinum rewards) but regardless of time left,
                        lives left or champions killed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every week in the TWAB the top 3 teams (score
                        and/or time) will be featured.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Modifiers have been split to only have one
                    benefit/drawback, i.e. Lightswitch/Chaff instead of Blackout.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every activity with modifiers has 3 modifiers that change
                    daily, heroic strikes have 5 unique modifiers per day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Modifiers are unique per activity i.e. Strike modifiers
                    differ from the reckoning, story missions and menagerie.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Checkpoints for joining allies have been added to
                    problematic Strikes to help keep fireteams grouped.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fixed several spawning issues, such as loading in at the
                    beginning of the strike while your team is near the end of
                    the strike.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Gambit</h3>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): Make the current gambit system more enjoyable.
                Give Gambit some much needed attention. 
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    2 Heavy ammo crates spawn simultaneously and are now the
                    only source of heavy ammo.
                </li>
                <ul>
                <li>
                    Armaments/Finder mods etc. do not work in Gambit.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These crates give less ammo than previously but are
                    re-balanced around specific weapons/archetypes.
                </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Auto-respawn now has a more forgiving delay whilst you are
                    being revived (This should prevent cases where your
                    guardian auto-respawns despite being revived by an ally).
                </li>
                <li>
                    At least 1 new map added every other season or 2 every
                    expansion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    1-2 New bosses / rework current bosses with a unique
                    mechanic.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Nothing too complex, similar mechanics to the ascendant
                        primeval servitor to increase diversity, every other
                        season / expansion.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    Added a Freelance playlist.
                </li>
            </ul>
            All of the above fixes also apply to Gambit Prime.

            <h4>Gambit Prime</h4>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): Add some small quality of life changes to
                streamline the gambit prime reward loop.
            </h5>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    All Gambit maps have been added to the Gambit Prime
                    playlist.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Kell’s grave and Cathedral of Scars bosses teleport to
                        each sub-area after a damage phase due to the space
                        restrictions of the bank area.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    The Synthesiser has been changed to be similar to the
                    Chalice of Opulence, storing all current and future synths
                    (Freeing up inventory space) and slotting synths for use in
                    the reckoning. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Synths now last for the next 3 gambit prime matches played
                    instead of 30minutes (Leaving a game or disconnecting
                    reduces this number).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Diligent Invader, Reap ‘em all, Collect and Conquer and
                    Sentries Hold the Line Bounties no longer reward players
                    with the respective helmets (the helmets have been added to
                    the reckoning) and instead give 5 synths. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Reckoning</h4>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): More quality of life changes to streamline and

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Removed Weak and Middling motes of all kinds, as well as
                    both Illicit and Outlawed armours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Powerful Motes are now the sole type of Mote (Still
                    requires 3 synths to create).
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Motes are used exactly the same way as before.

                </ul>
                <li>
                    Every completion of Tier-3 grants players a Reckoning

                    1-2 new maps introduced every other season or every
                    expansion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We believe there are some issues that need to be addressed
                    with the Competitive(Survival) playlist, however. That is
                    something we would have to specifically look at but we also
                    lack the vast amounts of statistics and data bungie has. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Special Ammo also needs to be investigated. We do not like
                    the fact that 5-7 of the top10 most used weapons in any
                    given week are special weapons, with the #1 spot
                    consistently being held by a Special.

            <h3>Missions and Adventures</h3>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): Give Missions and Adventures replay factor.
                Give newer players loot from older expansions so they can
                experience weapons they may have missed, but also ways for
                veteran players to grind for weapons.
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There are now only 3 heroic story missions to choose from
                    daily: One randomly from D2Y1 (new light players) one from
                    D2Y2 (forsaken) and one from D2Y3 (shadowkeep).

                <li>
                    For each of the 3 available missions, a single weapon from
                    the corresponding expansion is assigned as loot which drops
                    upon every successful completion. This weapon is refreshed
                    daily.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A weekly reward (Powerful Tier1) for completing any
                    combination of 3 Heroic story missions or Adventures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3 Adventures are also available to play, rotating daily.
                    (Only selectable if the player has completed the
                    appropriate adventure on the destination)

            <h3>Factions</h3>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): Bring back an Integral, core aspect of
                Destiny. Factions are to be designed as a long lasting,
                background gameplay feature, whereby players can passively
                progress their favourite Faction to earn unique loot.
                Possibility to be expanded upon in the future i.e. Faction
                rallies rework or More unique loot.

                    allegiance to a faction.

                <li>
                    The Faction Badge stores Medals which are unique per
                    Faction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Medals are earned via core activities with an increased
                    chance from pinnacle activities. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Faction Vendors level up via a similar mechanic to Obelisks
                    from Season of Dawn.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Vanguard and Crucible Tokens can also be used to level up
                    Factions. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Vanguard and Crucible tokens are of equal value when
                    leveling up Factions. However, Medals are far more valuable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Leveling up a faction rewards the player with a choice of
                    either a weapon or armour engram (Faction loot from year1),
                    as well as 1 reputation point.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reputation points are used to purchase passive upgrades
                    (such as reducing the number of tokens required for a rank
                    up, chance of getting more faction rewards from core
                    gameplay modes, etc).

                </li>
                <li>
                    The Vanguard bounty pool has been adjusted with the
                    Gunsmith bounty pool in mind i.e. only Gunsmith bounties
                    require kills with weapons. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a minimum all bounties are now fireteam based (Similar
                    to trials bounties).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Added more varied challenges to the bounty pool,
                    specifically the weekly bounty pool, whilst ensuring they
                    are not to obscure or restrictive. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Re-purchasable bounties removed from every vendor barring
                    Zavala and Shaxx. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Both the Vanguard/Crucible weekly bounties now also reward
                    weapons/armour (Similar to Gambit weekly bounties).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Experience</h4>
            <h5>
                Overall Goal(s): Reduce the emphasis on bounties. Increase
                activity completion experience.
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    All activities have had the experience reward for
                    successful completions increased.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For playlists activities consecutive completions after the
                    first offer a bonus amount of experience stacking up to 2
                    times. This bonus is lost upon leaving a playlist/game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If players disconnect, but manage to reconnect back into
                    the same strike/crucible game, the bonus xp streak is not
                    lost.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multi-stage activities (such as dungeons/raids) award bonus
                    experience for each consecutive encounter that is
                    completed. This bonus is lost after leaving the activity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As a whole, more difficult activities reward more XP, e.g.
                    Strikes &lt; Heroic Strikes &lt; Raid Encounters.

                    There are now 3 enemy ‘commandos’ across the flashpoint.	
                </li>
                <li>
                    After hunting all 3 ‘commandos’ a final ‘commando’ spawns
                    inside a lost sector.

                <li>
                    Added a few new dialogs from the appropriate npc upon

                    (Last Wish still drops Ethereal keys, allowing for 5
                    pinnacles drops).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once completed, a raid can be re-completed, dropping
